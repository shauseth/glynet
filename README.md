# GlyNet

GlyNet is multi-task deep neural network for protein-glycan interactions.
* It uses CFG v5.0 microarray conclusive data for training.
* The inputs for glycans are subtree fingerprint descriptors.
* The output layer has 570 neurons for 570 different microarray slides.
* A fully trained GlyNet can predict interactions for ~4000 novel glycans.
